These are MATLAB dive figure files created by Caitie Kroeger, using dive analysis stats from IKNOS. This data has been time and pressure corrected, and zero-offset. The yellow points represent the end of a dive, the green points represent the beginning of the dive, and the red dots indicate the start and end of bottom time.
