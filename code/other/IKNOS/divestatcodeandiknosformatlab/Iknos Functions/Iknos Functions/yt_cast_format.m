
function res=yt_cast_format(matrix)
% res=yt_cast_format(matrix); format a matrix of [depth,value1,value2] obtained with
% animal borne recorders in a CTD cast format.
%
% INPUTS:
% matrix must have depth in first column (positive values), and any other number of data
% recorded along the depth axis.
%
% OUTPUT:
% res has depth every meter from 0 to max(depth) in first column and the
% corresponding interpolated values in the adjacent columns.
% Interpolation is done using hermite spline (pchip). PCHIP was chosen because it has no
% overshoots and less oscillation if the data are not smooth, compared to SPLINE.
% When several values for a single depth valus are recorded, the median is
% calculated for this depth.
%
% CREDIT:
% Created by Yann Tremblay (The IKNOS toolbox)
% Created October 11th 2004.
% Modified 29 April 2005: when input data had NaNs (or too many NaNs), the
% Pchip interpolation didn't work. This was accounted for.
